##Database design for a hypothetical small chicken noodle and its SQL queries

In this project, I tried to imagine that I have a chicken noodle stall. To analyze my customers, I designed a simple database in hope that I could improve my sales through the data I store in this database. In this repository, I uploaded the Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) and its SQL queries to create them.
